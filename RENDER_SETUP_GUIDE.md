# 🚀 Complete Render Setup Guide for EthioHeritage360

## 🤖 Step 1: Add OpenAI API Key to Render

### Why You Need This:
Your platform has built-in AI features but they're hidden because the API key is missing.

### How to Add OpenAI API Key:

1. **Get OpenAI API Key** (2 minutes):
   - Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Sign up/login to OpenAI account
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

2. **Add to Render Environment** (1 minute):
   - Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
   - Select your "EthioHeritage360" service
   - Click **"Environment"** in left sidebar
   - Click **"Add Environment Variable"**
   - **Key**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `sk-your-actual-openai-key-here`
   - Click **"Save Changes"**

3. **Redeploy Service**:
   - Render will automatically redeploy
   - Wait for deployment to complete

### ✅ Result:
- AI chatbot will become visible
- Artifact description generation enabled
- Multi-language translation active
- Educational content creation available

## 📁 Step 2: Set Up Download Functionality

### Current Issue:
Downloads may not work properly in Render's ephemeral file system.

### Solution - Use Render Disks:

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**:
   - Select your EthioHeritage360 service
   - Click **"Disks"** in left sidebar

2. **Add Persistent Disk**:
   - Click **"Add Disk"**
   - **Name**: `heritage-files`
   - **Mount Path**: `/opt/render/project/src/server/uploads`
   - **Size**: `1GB` (free tier) or larger
   - Click **"Create"**

3. **Redeploy Service** after adding disk

### ✅ Result:
- Uploaded files persist between deployments
- Download functionality works properly
- File storage is reliable

## 🌐 Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Add these additional environment variables in Render:

### Required Variables:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

### Optional but Recommended:
```bash
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=1000
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
```

## 🧪 Step 4: Test Your Setup

After adding the OpenAI API key and disk, test these URLs:

### Test OpenAI Integration:
```
https://ethioheritage360-ethiopian-heritage.onrender.com/api/openai/status
```

### Test File Downloads:
```
https://ethioheritage360-ethiopian-heritage.onrender.com/api/artifacts
```

### Test AI Chatbot:
```
POST https://ethioheritage360-ethiopian-heritage.onrender.com/api/openai/chat
