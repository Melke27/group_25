### âœ… Intelligent Response System
- **Contextual Understanding**: Analyzes user questions using keyword matching and patterns
- **Topic Categories**: Supports multiple topics including:
  - Greetings and general inquiries
  - Account and profile management
  - Museum operations and artifact management
  - Technical support and troubleshooting
  - User roles and permissions
- **Dynamic Suggestions**: Provides relevant follow-up questions
- **Reference Links**: Includes helpful links and resources

### âœ… User Experience Features
- **Conversation History**: Tracks and displays recent chat interactions
- **Quick Suggestions**: Pre-built question suggestions for common topics
- **Typing Indicators**: Real-time feedback during response generation
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on all device sizes

## Frontend Integration

### EnhancedChatbot Component

The `EnhancedChatbot` component automatically:

1. **Calls Backend API First**: Sends user questions to `/api/chat/ask`
2. **Handles Authentication**: Includes JWT token if user is logged in
3. **Processes Responses**: Displays answers, suggestions, and references
4. **Falls Back Gracefully**: Uses local intelligence if API fails
5. **Manages State**: Tracks conversation history and user interactions

### chatService Integration

The `chatService.askQuestion()` method:
- Sends requests with full context (chat history, user info, metadata)
- Handles authentication tokens automatically
- Provides error handling and retry logic
- Returns structured responses with answers, suggestions, and references

## Environment Setup

### Backend Requirements

1. **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure MongoDB is running and connected
2. **Environment Variables**: Set up required environment variables:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ethioheritage360
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   PORT=5000
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

3. **Dependencies**: All required npm packages are included in package.json

### Database Schema

The chatbot uses the User model with an added `chatHistory` field:

```javascript
chatHistory: [{
  question: String,
  answer: String,
  timestamp: Date,
  metadata: {
    confidence: String,
    suggestions: [String],
    references: [{
      title: String,
      url: String,
      description: String
    }],
    conversationId: String,
    userAgent: String,
    ipAddress: String
  }
}]
```

## Usage Instructions

```javascript
const responses = {
  newTopic: {
    keywords: ['keyword1', 'keyword2'],
    responses: [
      'Response option 1',
      'Response option 2'
    ],
    suggestions: [
      'Related question 1',
      'Related question 2'
    ]
  }
};
```
