2. Use the frontend or API client to test features
3. Verify database updates and relationships
4. Test social media link generation

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration

#### Sharing Progress Component
```javascript
const shareProgress = async (progressData) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/community/share-progress', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(progressData)
    });
    
    const result = await response.json();
    
    if (result.success) {
      // Show success message
      // Display social sharing links if needed
      console.log('Shared to:', result.data.socialLinks);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Sharing failed:', error);
  }
};
```

#### Friend Search Component
```javascript
const searchFriends = async (searchParams) => {
  const queryString = new URLSearchParams(searchParams).toString();
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/community/find-friends?${queryString}`, {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
    });
    
    const result = await response.json();
    
    if (result.success) {
      return result.data.data.map(user => ({
        ...user,
        canFollow: !user.relationshipStatus.isFollowing,
        mutualConnections: user.relationshipStatus.mutualConnectionsCount
      }));
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Friend search failed:', error);
    return [];
  }
};
```

### Backend Integration

#### Using in Other Controllers
```javascript
const { Activity, Follow } = require('../models/Community');

// Create activity when user completes course
const createProgressActivity = async (userId, courseId, courseName) => {
  await new Activity({
    user: userId,
    type: 'course_completed',
    entityType: 'course',
    entityId: courseId,
    entityName: courseName,
    isPublic: true
  }).save();
};

// Get user's social stats
const getUserSocialStats = async (userId) => {
  const [followerCount, followingCount] = await Promise.all([
    Follow.countDocuments({ following: userId }),
    Follow.countDocuments({ follower: userId })
  ]);
  
  return { followerCount, followingCount };
};
```

## Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Frontend URL for social sharing links
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Social media integration (optional)
