## 📊 Frontend Integration Points

The implemented API endpoints are designed to work with the frontend components mentioned in the implementation plan:

### **ArtifactManagement.jsx** Integration Points:
- `GET /api/artifacts` - For artifact listing with grid/table views
- `PUT /api/artifacts/:id/status` - For status updates
- `PUT /api/artifacts/:id/featured` - For featured toggle
- `GET /api/artifacts/search` - For filtering and search

### **MuseumArtifactUpload.jsx** Integration Points:
- `POST /api/artifacts` - For artifact creation
- `POST /api/artifacts/:id/images` - For image uploads
- `POST /api/artifacts/:id/model` - For 3D model uploads

### **MuseumManagement.jsx** Integration Points:
- `GET /api/artifacts/museum/:id` - For museum-specific artifact listing
