2. **Learning API** (`/api/learning/`)
   - Public course browsing and detailed course access
   - Progress tracking with optional authentication
   - Achievement and certification system
   - Course enrollment and user management

3. **Student Dashboard API** (`/api/student/`)
   - Complete student analytics and dashboard

## 🔧 What Was Missing and Added

### New Education API Routes (`server/routes/educationApi.js`)
Created new endpoints that perfectly match your frontend `educationService.js`:

1. **Course Management**
   - `GET /api/courses` - Get all courses with filters
   - `GET /api/courses/featured` - Get featured courses
   - `GET /api/courses/categories` - Get course categories with counts
   - `GET /api/courses/:courseId` - Get single course details
   - `POST /api/courses/:courseId/enroll` - Enroll in course
   - `PUT /api/courses/:courseId/progress` - Update course progress

2. **User Learning Data**
   - `GET /api/user/courses/enrolled` - Get user's enrolled courses
   - `GET /api/user/courses/completed` - Get user's completed courses  
   - `GET /api/user/learning/stats` - Get comprehensive learning statistics

3. **Certificates**
   - `GET /api/user/certificates` - Get user's certificates
   - `GET /api/certificates/:certificateId/download` - Download certificate

4. **Study Guides**
   - `GET /api/study-guides` - Get study guides (with mock data)

5. **Educational Tours**
   - `GET /api/tours/educational` - Get educational tours

### Integration Updates

1. **Server Configuration** (`server/server.js`)
   - Added new education API routes registration
   - Integrated with existing middleware and authentication system

2. **Documentation** (`docs/EDUCATION_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`)
   - Comprehensive API documentation covering all educational endpoints
   - Request/response examples for each endpoint
   - Authentication and authorization requirements
   - Error handling and data models

3. **Testing** (`server/test/education-api-test.js`)
   - Integration test script to verify all endpoints are working
   - Automated testing for both public and authenticated routes
