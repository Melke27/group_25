# Render Deployment Quick Fix Guide

## Current Issue Fixed

The deployment was failing because:
- The validation script couldn't find the `dotenv` module during build
- The prestart script was causing deployment failures

## Changes Made

1. **Switched to Docker runtime** - More reliable dependency management
2. **Created optimized Dockerfile** - Ensures proper Node.js environment
3. **Removed prestart validation** - Prevents deployment failures
4. **Made dotenv loading resilient** - Scripts now work without dotenv
5. **Removed problematic local dependency** - Cleaner package.json

## Environment Variables Required in Render Dashboard

Set these in your Render service dashboard:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://ethioheritage360:ethioheritage360@atlascluster.lkj5o.mongodb.net/ethioheritage360?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=[your-generated-secret]
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=[your-generated-refresh-secret]
DB_NAME=ethioheritage360
```

## Deploy Steps

1. **Push these changes** (already done)
2. **Go to Render Dashboard** → Your service
3. **Set Environment Variables** (see above)
4. **Trigger a new deployment**
5. **Check logs** for any remaining issues

## If Still Failing

Try these quick fixes:

1. **Clear Build Cache**: In Render dashboard → Settings → Clear build cache
2. **Manual Redeploy**: Trigger a manual deploy from dashboard
3. **Check Logs**: Look for specific error messages

## Test After Deployment

Once deployed successfully, test these endpoints:
- `https://your-service.onrender.com/api/health` - Health check
- `https://your-service.onrender.com/api/auth` - API availability

## MongoDB Atlas Settings

Ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster:
- Has IP whitelist set to `0.0.0.0/0` (allow all)
- Uses the correct connection string above
- Database user has read/write permissions

## Support

If issues persist after trying these fixes, the deployment logs will show specific error messages to troubleshoot further.
